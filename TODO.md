#Todo-list
* Restructure running the program, AI's should have their own threads and copies of board to play with, which start running as game is started AND NOT IN EVENT DISPATCH THREAD.
* Add static exchange evaluation to improve AI
* Add coloring to last move so it'smuch easier to spot.
* Improve evaluation function by adding king safety/pawn structure
* Add memory for moves and function that allows players to undo their moves
* Add menu that allows players to restart game/return to main menu during game.

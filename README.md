# SamsChessAI

I'm planning to see what I can do with this chess AI for fun. I'll continue from where I was left with [my old repo](https://github.com/salsam/simpleChessAI) that was my work for Datastructures and Algorithms project. Without much chess knowledge, this probably won't have very complex evaluation function. Thus I'll be focusing on practising different ways of speeding up basic negamax-algorithm. Most of this will be based on chessprogramming.wikispaces.com and wikipedia, which I'll be reading to get further ideas for improvements.
